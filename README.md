# Chat bot for discord

Learning git and discord bot.


## Notes
1. In CMD type:
    node .
or 
    npm discordbot.js
to run the discord bot / get it online --> must be in the directory file i.e use cd discord-chat-bot

2. crt-c will allow you to exit msg displayed after chatbot comes online in terminal 

3. Make sure to save file before running

4. 


## to do:
 - make list of commands of things you want it to do
     - for now I want it to bag out danbot
     - need to make command for it to start and stop commenting on every post that danbot makes
     - maybe first make it react to every danbot post
     



## finished
 - command file/list
 - main control setup
